# Stock Copilot Pro

Global Multi-Source Stock Analysis with QVeris.

## What This Skill Does

Stock Copilot Pro performs end-to-end stock analysis with five data domains:

1. Market quote / trading context
2. Fundamental metrics
3. Technical signals (RSI/MACD/MA)
4. News and sentiment
5. X sentiment

It then generates a structured markdown report:
`summary / fundamentals / technicals / sentiment / risks / conclusion`.

## Key Advantages

- Dynamic tool learning that improves route quality over time
- Strong fallback strategy across providers and markets
- US/HK/CN market-aware symbol handling
- Structured outputs for both analyst reading and machine ingestion
- Safety-first handling of secrets and runtime state

## Core Workflow

1. Resolve user input to symbol + market (supports company-name aliases, e.g. `特变电工` -> `600089.SH`).
2. Search tools by capability (quote, fundamentals, indicators, sentiment, X sentiment).
3. Rank candidates by `success_rate`, latency, parameter fit, and market-native provider preference.
   - For CN/HK sentiment, prioritize `caidazi` channels (report/news/wechat).
   - For CN/HK fundamentals, prioritize THS financial statements (income/balance sheet/cash flow), then fallback to company basics.
4. Try learned priority queue first, then execute fallback candidates.
5. Run quality checks:
   - Missing key fields
   - Data recency
   - Cross-source inconsistency
6. Produce report with confidence score and explicit caveats.

## Command Surface

Primary script: `scripts/stock_copilot_pro.mjs`

- Analyze one symbol:
  - `node scripts/stock_copilot_pro.mjs analyze --symbol AAPL --market US --mode comprehensive`
  - `node scripts/stock_copilot_pro.mjs analyze --symbol "特变电工" --mode comprehensive`
- Compare multiple symbols:
  - `node scripts/stock_copilot_pro.mjs compare --symbols AAPL,MSFT --market US --mode comprehensive`

## CN/HK Coverage Details

- Company-name input is supported and auto-resolved to market + symbol for common names.
- Sentiment path prioritizes `caidazi` (research reports, news, wechat/public-account channels).
- Fundamentals path prioritizes THS financial statements endpoints and extracts key fields such as:
  - `revenue`
  - `netProfit`
  - `totalAssets`
  - `totalLiabilities`
  - `operatingCashflow`

## Output Modes

- `markdown` (default): human-readable report
- `json`: machine-readable merged payload

## Dynamic Evolution

- Runtime learning state is stored in `.evolution/tool-evolution.json`.
- Admission policy is aggressive: one successful tool execution can enter queue.
- Future runs prioritize previously successful tools to improve execution reliability.
- Use `--no-evolution` to disable loading/saving runtime learning state.

## Safety and Disclosure

- Uses only `QVERIS_API_KEY`.
- Calls only QVeris APIs over HTTPS.
- Does not store API keys in logs, reports, or evolution state.
- Runtime persistence is limited to `.evolution/tool-evolution.json` (tool routing stats only).
- No package installation or arbitrary command execution is performed by this skill script.
- Research-only output. Not investment advice.
