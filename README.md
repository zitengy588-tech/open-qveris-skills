# Open QVeris Skills

This repository hosts **QVeris** ([`qveris.ai`](https://qveris.ai)) related bot/agent skills.

- **Feel free to use these skills**: Use them as-is, fork them, and adapt them for your own bots/agents.
- **Contributions welcome**: New skills, improvements, fixes, and documentation updates are encouraged.

## Repository structure

- **One skill per folder**: Each top-level folder represents a standalone skill.
- `qveris-official/`: The **official QVeris skill** (core capabilities — semantic tool discovery & unified execution).
  - Use it as a starting point: you can modify it (or ask your AI to modify it) to create **novel, useful skills** tailored to your workflow.
- `stock-copilot-pro/`: A **standalone global stock analysis skill** for ClawHub/OpenClaw style agents.
  - Includes multi-source routing (quote, fundamentals, technicals, sentiment), quality checks, and structured reports.
- **Planned skills**: Development and testing are currently underway.
  - `exchange-rate/` – Real-time forex rate and amount conversion.
  - `stock-analyzer/` – A-share/global quote, fundamentals, history, smart stock picking.
  - `crypto-tracker/` – Crypto price, markets, conversion (CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko).
  - `news-briefing/` – News and WeChat article search (caidazi, xiaosu, X news).
  - `location-service/` – POI and IP location (Amap, Baidu Map).
  - `movie-guide/` – Movie/TV details and reviews (IMDb, NYT).
  - `developer-tools/` – IP lookup and geo.
  - `content-discovery/` – Taobao, Xiaohongshu, Kuaishou search.
  - `weather-alerts/` – Weather alerts and air quality (AQI) by location.
  - `term-translation/` – Term/phrase translation (e.g. Data.gov).
  - `food-nutrition/` – Food search and nutrition (USDA FoodData Central).
  - `sports-score/` – Sports leagues, games, standings (API-Sports, Api-Football).

## Getting started

- Pick a skill folder (for example `qveris-official/`) and follow its README:
  - See `qveris-official/README.md`
- Skills that call QVeris APIs typically require:
  - `QVERIS_API_KEY` (get one from [`qveris.ai`](https://qveris.ai))

## Local development (not part of published skill package)

Local integration files live under `dev-infra/` and are intentionally kept
outside skill folders such as `stock-copilot-pro/`.

Reuse repository root `.env.local` for all local workflows (`skill-dev` and
optional `openclaw` compose profile). No extra `.env` files are required under
`dev-infra/`.

- Bring up dev container: `make up`
- Check runtime: `make check`
- Run smoke regression (`allow-degraded` for live API variance): `make smoke`
- Bring up OpenClaw too: `make up-full`
- Stop containers: `make down`

Repository root `.env.local` is git-ignored by default to avoid accidental key
commits.

## Contributing

- Add a new folder for a new skill (or improve an existing one).
- Include clear documentation (a `README.md` and/or `SKILL.md`) describing:
  - What the skill does
  - Required environment variables / credentials
  - Example prompts / usage
